# Configuration {#sec-config}

Prior to each deployment of the Mini Buoy, the data logger will need to be fully charged, have a full memory, and be correctly configured according to the user's requirements. The following section describes how to configure the MSR145W B4 (used in both the B4 and B4+ Mini Buoy designs) and HOBO Pendant G acceleration data loggers.

## MSR145

The MSR145W B4 comes with a USB charging cable. Free software to configure the logger can be downloaded [here](https://www.msr.ch/en/support/msr-pc-software-standard/){target='_blank'}. At present, the logger is only compatible with a Windows PC. To configure the MSR145W B4:

1. Download and install the [MSR software](https://www.msr.ch/en/support/pcsoftware/){target='_blank'} 
2. Connect a logger to a Windows PC. A yellow LED will light up on the logger, indicating the internal battery is being charged. The light will extinguish once the battery is fully charged
3. Open the MSR software
4. Double-click `Setup`

5. Select the `Format memory` tab
6. Click `Format`. This will delete any data stored on the logger

7. Once formatting is complete, select the `User settings` tab
8. Set the acceleration sensor measure range to `2G`
9. You can define a name for the logger under `Name of logger`
10. Click `Write user settings`

11. Under `Record control`, check the `Limits active` box
12. Select the `Limits` tab. We can use limits to effectively disable the X and Y sensors by setting unrealistically high acceleration limits. This will allow your logger to store more Y acceleration data.
13. For the **ACC x** channel, select `<L1 or >L2, (Shock)` from the record limit drop-down menu (click on the cell to make the drop-down menu visible)
14. For the **ACC z** channel, select `<L1 or >L2, (Shock)` from the record limit drop-down menu (click on the cell to make the drop-down menu visible) 
15. Set the corresponding `Limit L1` to -999 and `Limit L2` to +999. The MSR software will default to the maximum possible range
16. Make sure there are no limits set on the ACC y channel by selecting `inactive` from the record limit drop-down menu
17. Click the `<` button in the bottom-left of the window

18. Select the `Basic settings` tab
19. Under `Sensors`, select `t1` from the `ACC x, y, z` drop-down menu
20. Under `Main storage rate`, set `t1=` to the desired sampling rate in seconds
    * The Mini Buoy has been calibrated to accept sampling rates between 1 and 10 seconds. Refer to the table in @sec-intro for sampling duration (this is more accurate than the `Prediction` tool that underestimates memory capacity as it does not take into account the limit settings).
21. Check the `Start at` box, and set the date and time shortly after your planned deployment
22. Under `Options during record`, uncheck all options. This will extend the battery life of the logger
23. Click `Write basic settings` to upload your settings to the logger
24. Click `Exit` and disconnect the MSR145W B4 logger from the computer
25. A blue light will begin to flash, confirming the logger is primed and ready to begin logging when the start date and time is reached

## HOBOware

The Pendant G Data Logger comes with the free [HOBOware](https://www.onsetcomp.com/hoboware-free-download/){target='_blank'} software to configure the logger. HOBOware is compatible with Windows and macOS operating systems. To configure the HOBO Pendant:

1. Download and install the free [HOBOware](https://www.onsetcomp.com/hoboware-free-download/){target='_blank'} software
2. Connect a logger to a computer via the HOBO Optic USB Base Station
3. Open the HOBOware software
4. Click the `Select Device` drop-down menu ![](figs/SelectDeviceButton.png){width=5%} , and tick the USB or serial port tabs in congruence with how you connected the data logger to the computer
5. Select the `Launch` icon ![](figs/LaunchDeviceBUtton.png){width=4%} , a window will pop open where you can set a name for the logger under the `Name` field.
5. In the `Sensors` tab and in the `Configure Sensors to Log` section, check the `X-Axis Acceleration (+/- 3g)` box
6. From the `Deployments` tab, set the `Logging Interval` to the desired sampling rate using the drop-down menu. Increasing the sampling rate will increase the logging duration (calculated based on the logging rate and battery status of the device).
    * The Mini Buoy has been calibrated to sampling rates of 1 minute, thus, this is the recommended sampling rate setting, rendering 45 logging days at full battery (refer to the table in @sec-intro for other sampling rates that can be used with Hobo pendant G loggers).
7. In the `Deployments` tab, set the `Start Logging` date and time for shortly after your planned deployment  
8. Click `Delayed Start` and disconnect the Pendant logger from the computer.
