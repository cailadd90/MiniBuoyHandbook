# Assembly

Depending on their requirements, the user has a choice of three Mini Buoy designs for measuring hydrodynamics (see @sec-intro). In the following steps, we provide instructions for the assembly of each design.

## B4

The B4 is a transparent and self-standing centrifuge tube with an MSR145W B4[^1] acceleration logger sealed inside and supported by floral foam. The tube is tethered to an anchor using fishing swivels attached through two holes in the centrifuge tube skirt. To build a B4, first gather the following equipment:

*	50 mL clear self-standing centrifuge tube 
*	Label
*	Floral foam
*	[MSR145W B4](https://www.msr.ch/en/product/msr145/){target='_blank'} acceleration data logger
*	Silicone sealant
*	Drill with a 4 mm dowel bit
*	3 × 5 cm (1.1 g) fishing swivels

To assemble the B4 Mini Buoy:

1. Place a label inside the centrifuge tube, with the text legible through the plastic, indicating the owner, a “do not remove” notice, and contact details 
2. Insert a 3 cm cylinder of floral foam into the centrifuge tube. This ensures the logger is positioned at the top of the tube
3. Roughly cut a 5 cm cylinder of floral foam with matching diameter of the centrifuge tube and cut down the middle
4. Place both halves around the configured MSR145W B4 acceleration data logger, then gently push the logger into the centrifuge tube with the PC connector facing outwards. The floral foam will prevent the logger from moving inside the tube
5. Apply silicone sealant around the screw thread of the centrifuge tube and fasten the cap
6. Apply more sealant along the rim of the centrifuge cap if necessary
7. Drill two holes at opposite ends through the centrifuge tube skirt 5 mm from the bottom
8. Fix two fishing swivels through each hole, and connect both to another swivel as shown:

## B4+

The B4+ almost identical in design to the B4, with some modifications: the centrifuge tube is UV-resistant without a skirt, an eye bolt and fishing line rings are fitted to provide more durability, and steel shot is added to the tube to increase sensitivity to current and wave action. Gather the following equipment to assemble the B4+:

* 50 mL UV-blocking centrifuge tube
* Sand paper
* Drill with a 4 mm dowel bit
* M4 Eye bolt and nut
* M4 rubber washer
* M4 long socket
* Epoxy glue
* M32 O-rings
* 20 g lead shot weight
* Floral foam
* Waterproof label 
* 250 lb / 113 kg nylon coated 1×7 steel strand fishing line
* Single barrel copper/nickel crimp sleeves (the sleeves should be rated to correctly fit the fishing line)
* Crimp tool with cutter (the tool should be rated to correctly crimp the sleeves)
* MSR145W B4 acceleration data logger
* Silicone sealant

To assemble the B4+ Mini Buoy:

1. Abrade the bottom of the centrifuge tube (this removes any lubricant on the tube and creates a better surface for the epoxy glue to bond with)
2. Drill a 4 mm hole in the bottom of the centrifuge tube
3. Thread the eye bolt through the hole 
4. Place the rubber washer over the eye bolt thread from inside the tube
5. Dab some epoxy glue around the eye bolt (inside and out) to seal the hole
6. Secure the nut in place using the long socket

7. To ensure watertightness, install a rubber o-ring around the inside lip of the lid using tweezers as shown:

8. Pour 20 g of steel shot into the tube. The shot reduces the buoyancy of the Mini Buoy, making it less stable in the water column. This has been shown to improve the accelerometer sensitivity
9. Cut a 3 cm length cylinder from the floral foam that will fit comfortably into the tube
10. Insert the floral foam cylinder into the tube. This holds the steel shot in place and ensures the logger is positioned at the top of the tube  
11. Attach a waterproof label onto the centrifuge tube indicating the owner, a "do not remove" notice, and contact details 
12. Thread the fishing line through a crimp sleeve and loop the fishing line back on itself to form a ring of ~2 cm diameter
13. Crimp the sleeve so it fits tightly around the fishing line 
14. Thread another fishing line through a new crimp sleeve, then through the eye bolt and first fishing line ring
15. Adjust the diameter of the ring so the total chain length is 4 cm, then crimp (the B4+ has been calibrated to measure hydrodynamics 4 cm above the tidal flat). The tether should look as follows:

16. Roughly cut a 5 cm cylinder of floral foam with matching diameter of the centrifuge tube and cut down the middle
17. Place both halves around the configured MSR145W B4 acceleration data logger, then gently push the logger into the centrifuge tube with the PC connector facing upright. The floral foam will prevent the logger from moving inside the tube
18.	Apply silicone sealant around the screw thread of the centrifuge tube and fasten the tube cap
19.	Apply more sealant along the rim of the centrifuge cap

## Pendant

The Pendant[^2] can be directly tethered to a pole in the ground using fishing swivels as the logger itself is buoyant and waterproof. Gather the following equipment:

* [HOBO Pendant G](https://www.onsetcomp.com/products/data-loggers/ua-004-64/){target='_blank'} acceleration data logger
* [HOBO Optic USB Base Station](https://www.onsetcomp.com/products/communications/base-u-4){target='_blank'} necessary for connecting the logger to the PC
* 5 cm (1.1 g) fishing swivel

To assemble the Pendant Mini Buoy, simply attach the fishing swivel to the anchor point on the Pendant logger as shown:
