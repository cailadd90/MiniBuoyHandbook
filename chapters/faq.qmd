### Is data lost if the logger runs out of battery?
No. The data will be preserved even if a Mini Buoy runs out of battery.

### Do I need to remove irrelevant data on the MSR software?
You can do this either when exporting data in the MSR software (see ) or 

can select usable data by dragging and dropping a window around the data using left-click. Otherwise data filtering can be done in the Mini Buoy App.
