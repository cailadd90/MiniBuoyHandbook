7. The data should look similar to the graph below, with low tide recorded as 0 and high tide recorded around -1. Any data at the start and end of the deployment which is not part of the desired measurement period can be removed by using the cross arrows button and selecting the period of interest. The graph should always start and end with a period of low tide (i.e. 0 y acceleration)
