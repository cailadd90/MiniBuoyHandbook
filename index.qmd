# Preface {.unnumbered}

The 'Mini Buoy' is an applied research tool to measure inundation duration, current velocity, and wave orbital velocity in shallow coastal settings using accelerometer technology. As a low cost and open-source solution, Mini Buoys and the associated App are a useful alternative to conventional hydrodynamic sensors. 

This guide provides an overview of how the Mini Buoy works, how to configure and deploy them, and how to analyse the data[^1].
